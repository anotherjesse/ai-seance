## Instructions:

- visit the website
- type a new prompt, hit enter to load
- hit escape to clear the text input

## TODO

high priority:

- [ ] allow prompter to set seed
- [ ] play sound effect when running a new prompt
- [ ] record of prompts and outputs
- [x] empty text input if prompter hits escape
- [ ] determine correct model (currently SD3)

medium priority:
- [ ] prompts longer than input don't display correctly clipped
- [ ] some protection for running new prompts?

low priority:
- [ ] allow multiple viewers to share remote view (use durable objects?)
- [ ] allow prompter to choose model (sd3 vs other fast-ish models?)
